# Bank Website Remake

This repository contains the code for my personal project: a remake of a Bank Website. The goal of this project is to recreate a bank website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if applicable). I aim to build a responsive website using the fundamentals of web development before diving into package managers and using libraries.

## Project Overview

As part of my learning journey in web development, I decided to recreate a bank homepage from scratch. I chose to use pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (if necessary) to ensure a strong foundation and deepen my understanding of front-end development concepts.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website will be optimized for various devices, ensuring a smooth user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** This project will solely rely on these core web technologies to demonstrate my skills in front-end development.

## Objectives

My main objectives for this project are:

1. **Recreating the Design:** I will strive to faithfully replicate the design of the original bank website while ensuring it is visually appealing and user-friendly.

2. **Responsive Layout:** Implementing responsive design principles to make the website adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.

3. **Code Quality:** Writing clean, well-structured code and following best practices in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
